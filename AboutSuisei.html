            <p>
                Hoshimachi Suisei (星街すいせい) is a female Japanese Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive. Originally an independent VTuber who eventually was recruited into hololive production's label INoNaKa Music, she was transferred to the main hololive branch on 1 December 2019. She is currently part of "hololive 0th gen" alongside fellow solo debutants: Tokino Sora, Roboco, Sakura Miko and AZKi.<br>
            </p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
            <p>
                Suisei is a modest, multi-talented singer and aspiring idol who is among the more level-headed members of hololive, though she also has a childish streak. After her unexpectedly compelling performance as a traitor in a game of Project Winter, she gained a reputation for remorseless sociopathy behind a facade of polite sweetness. No one seems to know how much of the "Psychopath Suisei" persona is real or not, but Suisei herself acknowledges that it is extremely funny and has referred to the incident on multiple occasions.<br>
